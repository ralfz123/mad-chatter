&lt;p&gt;Race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender are complex topics. For years, the world has been trying to move past certain stereotypes and transcend prejudice. However, as technology and design advance, they uncover more deep-seated, more unconscious biases dwelling in the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we&amp;rsquo;d like to explore a less technical topic. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at some unfortunate design, copy, and tech decisions made by massive international brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that these decisions&amp;rsquo; repercussions could have easily been mitigated if only these products were developed with diversity in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A glimpse of the problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, we saw what seems like one of the most unfortunate combinations of tech and racism. A machine learning (ML) risk assessment algorithm used by the US court was shown to be heavily biased against black prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The program, Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (Compas), was much more prone to mistakenly label black defendants as likely to reoffend &amp;mdash; wrongly flagging them at almost twice the rate as white people (45% to 24%)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case had shown us that we might have to deal with a new wave of a systemic and more technological strain of discrimination. More importantly, it shed some light on the complexity of the problem we all have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;White buyer personae&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many tech companies are trying to create more diverse workspaces, racism seeped into the tech side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Compas&lt;/em&gt; case, unfortunately, wasn&amp;rsquo;t some sort of turning point for tech companies. As awareness grew, we started seeing more and more of the unconscious bias permeating products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a variety of fitness trackers such as Fitbit and Apple Watch that don&amp;rsquo;t work properly on dark or tattooed skin. This is probably an issue that stems from their R&amp;amp;D departments&amp;rsquo; unwillingness to test or invest in finding solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, we can assume that black customers are an edge case for many tech companies, and it seems that their buyer personae are predominantly white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/14/7684&quot;&gt;study published by Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; indicates that conversational user interfaces are somewhat racially divided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested five voice-assistants from five large companies and established that the interfaces recognize more words spoken by white users compared to black users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devices misidentified 19% of words pronounced by white people, and 2% of the sequences were deemed unreadable. The same statistics clock in at 35% and 20% for black people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Masters and slaves&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked with computer parts, CRMs or code, you&amp;rsquo;ve most definitely come across the terms &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;slave.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many companies and corporations have long abandoned these archaic and unnecessarily cruel terms, many still haven&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of renaming these terms has been given a new impetus with the BLM protests in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many businesses have replaced these terms with &amp;ldquo;Primary&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Replica&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Main&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Secondary.&amp;rdquo; There is an endless spectrum of opportunities that allows us to rename this relationship without having to surface some of the most shameful of human behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github, home to over 40 million users worldwide, has only very recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-github-terms-master-slave-blacklist-whitelist-open-source-2020-6&quot;&gt;decided to abandon&lt;/a&gt; the usage of &amp;ldquo;master,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;slave,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;blacklist.&amp;rdquo; While these are tiny steps towards improvement, they are a vital part of our journey towards equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The default&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icons and avatars are very often subject to inherent bias. Unfortunately, this isn&amp;rsquo;t just an assumption &amp;mdash; there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of evidence to suggest it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/6281/5883&quot;&gt;article published&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace states the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;When asked to pick a typical human, people are more likely to pick a man than a woman, a phenomenon reflecting androcentrism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;tech platforms and androcentrism&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*vu2AWtYdF_zT3xpr?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;tech platforms and androcentrism&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*vu2AWtYdF_zT3xpr?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;tech platforms and androcentrism&quot; sizes=&quot;700px&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2880/0*vu2AWtYdF_zT3xpr&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*vu2AWtYdF_zT3xpr 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*vu2AWtYdF_zT3xpr 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*vu2AWtYdF_zT3xpr 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*vu2AWtYdF_zT3xpr 700w&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/6281/5883&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even social media giants, like Facebook, seem to be having issues with sorting this problem, given that your default avatar is still male unless stated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The European side of things&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this moment in time, the US in the middle of a large-scale revolution aimed at demolishing the vestiges of racism. This is why we thought we&amp;rsquo;d take a look at how European companies are dealing with this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, European brands are by no means overwhelmingly &amp;ldquo;woke.&amp;rdquo; Here, users and customers are also subjected to discriminatory marketing materials and interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;rsquo;ve just established that the &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; gender is male, then many European businesses consider the default race to be white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zalando is a very popular German eCommerce platform. Despite making efforts to make design more inclusive, they still end up using these default pictures, whatever your regional settings are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zalando settings&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*IkwWc5oR8UFapx5m?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zalando settings&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*IkwWc5oR8UFapx5m?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zalando settings&quot; sizes=&quot;700px&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2880/0*IkwWc5oR8UFapx5m&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*IkwWc5oR8UFapx5m 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*IkwWc5oR8UFapx5m 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*IkwWc5oR8UFapx5m 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*IkwWc5oR8UFapx5m 700w&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Zalando settings&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this isn&amp;rsquo;t an issue limited to a single brand. There&amp;rsquo;s a wide array of massively popular stores and brands that fail to have a more diverse approach to marketing their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo Boss and Zara are but a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hugo Boss App&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*jB7s9un0_AoMNga2?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hugo Boss App&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*jB7s9un0_AoMNga2?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hugo Boss App&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zara App&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*GN6wjrDo81Sv4kKi?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zara App&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*GN6wjrDo81Sv4kKi?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Zara App&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all fashion platforms are guilty of under-representing minorities. Asos, for instance, does a much better job of diversifying their models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Asos App&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*MZd5tCpKVrb2npkM?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Asos App&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*MZd5tCpKVrb2npkM?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Asos App&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The other side of the spectrum&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite end of underrepresentation is a racist representation. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever visited Austria, you may have had the chance to have some Julius Meinl coffee. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at its branding evolution through the years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Julius Meinl Logo and Branding evolution&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*jA7sJopP8NVZC_I8?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Julius Meinl Logo and Branding evolution&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*jA7sJopP8NVZC_I8?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Julius Meinl Logo and Branding evolution&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can notice the sudden transition from the act drinking coffee to the act of bowing with servitude. The new logo (2004) incorporates a slight rotation of the head. However, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume that the designer was more concerned with the balance of the logo, rather than its racist connotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Julius Meinl II&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/44/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Julius Meinl II&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/44/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ?q=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Julius Meinl II&quot; sizes=&quot;700px&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2880/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ 700w&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Julius Meinl II&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a variety of established American companies like Eskimo Pie, Aunt Jemima, and Uncle Ben&amp;rsquo;s have made the right choice to discard their racist branding and opt for a more neutral representation of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The take-away&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our society has gone a long way from where it used to stand on identity issues. However, that does not mean that we&amp;rsquo;re close to an equal society or that we&amp;rsquo;ve dismantled systemic and inherent bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most probably, the solution to this series of issues isn&amp;rsquo;t to simply check boxes in our marketing, branding, or interface guidelines, but rather adopt an approach that features continuous inquiry and thorough analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essential part of the solution to systemic under- or misrepresentation is diversity in the workplace. It&amp;rsquo;s essential that organizations empower minorities and favor their participation in branding and marketing decision-making. As a result, this could lead to a more accurate and self-aware outlook on issues of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how much empathy he has or how much good intention behind his actions, a white male might still carry some bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, black lives matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we must also remain mindful of the idea that this is but a point of departure towards a better society and better technology.&lt;/p&gt;" dir="ltr"><figure><img alt="On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_dpiH338xV56EzmDc"><img alt="On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_dpiH338xV56EzmDc"><img alt="On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech" sizes="700px" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_dpiH338xV56EzmDc(1)" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*dpiH338xV56EzmDc 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*dpiH338xV56EzmDc 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*dpiH338xV56EzmDc 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*dpiH338xV56EzmDc 700w"></figure>
<p>Race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender are complex topics. For years, the world has been trying to move past certain stereotypes and transcend prejudice. However, as technology and design advance, they uncover more deep-seated, more unconscious biases dwelling in the human mind.</p>
<p>Today, we’d like to explore a less technical topic. In this article, we’ll take a look at some unfortunate design, copy, and tech decisions made by massive international brands.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that these decisions’ repercussions could have easily been mitigated if only these products were developed with diversity in mind.</p>
<p>Let’s dive right in.</p>
<h1>A glimpse of the problem</h1>
<p>In 2017, we saw what seems like one of the most unfortunate combinations of tech and racism. A machine learning (ML) risk assessment algorithm used by the US court was shown to be heavily biased against black prisoners.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The program, Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (Compas), was much more prone to mistakenly label black defendants as likely to reoffend — wrongly flagging them at almost twice the rate as white people (45% to 24%)”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This case had shown us that we might have to deal with a new wave of a systemic and more technological strain of discrimination. More importantly, it shed some light on the complexity of the problem we all have to deal with.</p>
<h1>White buyer personae</h1>
<p>While many tech companies are trying to create more diverse workspaces, racism seeped into the tech side of things.</p>
<p>The <em>Compas</em> case, unfortunately, wasn’t some sort of turning point for tech companies. As awareness grew, we started seeing more and more of the unconscious bias permeating products.</p>
<p>There is still a variety of fitness trackers such as Fitbit and Apple Watch that don’t work properly on dark or tattooed skin. This is probably an issue that stems from their R&amp;D departments’ unwillingness to test or invest in finding solutions.</p>
<p>From this, we can assume that black customers are an edge case for many tech companies, and it seems that their buyer personae are predominantly white.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/14/7684">study published by Stanford University</a> indicates that conversational user interfaces are somewhat racially divided.</p>
<p>The researchers tested five voice-assistants from five large companies and established that the interfaces recognize more words spoken by white users compared to black users.</p>
<p>The devices misidentified 19% of words pronounced by white people, and 2% of the sequences were deemed unreadable. The same statistics clock in at 35% and 20% for black people.</p>
<h1>Masters and slaves</h1>
<p>If you’ve ever worked with computer parts, CRMs or code, you’ve most definitely come across the terms “master” and “slave.”</p>
<p>While many companies and corporations have long abandoned these archaic and unnecessarily cruel terms, many still haven’t.</p>
<p>The idea of renaming these terms has been given a new impetus with the BLM protests in the US.</p>
<p>Many businesses have replaced these terms with “Primary” and “Replica” or “Main” and “Secondary.” There is an endless spectrum of opportunities that allows us to rename this relationship without having to surface some of the most shameful of human behaviors.</p>
<p>Github, home to over 40 million users worldwide, has only very recently <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-github-terms-master-slave-blacklist-whitelist-open-source-2020-6">decided to abandon</a> the usage of “master,” “slave,” and “blacklist.” While these are tiny steps towards improvement, they are a vital part of our journey towards equality.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this isn’t an issue limited to a single brand. There’s a wide array of massively popular stores and brands that fail to have a more diverse approach to marketing their products.</p>
<p>Hugo Boss and Zara are but a few examples:</p>
<figure><img alt="Hugo Boss App" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_jB7s9un0_AoMNga2"><img alt="Hugo Boss App" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_jB7s9un0_AoMNga2"><figcaption>Hugo Boss App</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img alt="Zara App" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_GN6wjrDo81Sv4kKi"><img alt="Zara App" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_GN6wjrDo81Sv4kKi"><figcaption>Zara App</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, not all fashion platforms are guilty of under-representing minorities. Asos, for instance, does a much better job of diversifying their models.</p>
<figure><img alt="Asos App" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_MZd5tCpKVrb2npkM"><img alt="Asos App" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_MZd5tCpKVrb2npkM"><figcaption>Asos App</figcaption></figure>
<h1>The other side of the spectrum</h1>
<p>The opposite end of underrepresentation is a racist representation. If you’ve ever visited Austria, you may have had the chance to have some Julius Meinl coffee. Let’s take a look at its branding evolution through the years:</p>
<figure><img alt="Julius Meinl Logo and Branding evolution" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_jA7sJopP8NVZC_I8"><img alt="Julius Meinl Logo and Branding evolution" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_jA7sJopP8NVZC_I8"><figcaption>Julius Meinl Logo and Branding evolution</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can notice the sudden transition from the act drinking coffee to the act of bowing with servitude. The new logo (2004) incorporates a slight rotation of the head. However, it’s safe to assume that the designer was more concerned with the balance of the logo, rather than its racist connotation.</p>
<figure><img alt="Julius Meinl II" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ"><img alt="Julius Meinl II" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ"><img alt="Julius Meinl II" sizes="700px" src="./On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech_files/0_lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ(1)" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*lPSa_G0WOsN4WJhQ 700w"><figcaption>Julius Meinl II</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fortunately, a variety of established American companies like Eskimo Pie, Aunt Jemima, and Uncle Ben’s have made the right choice to discard their racist branding and opt for a more neutral representation of their products.</p>
<h1>The take-away</h1>
<p>Our society has gone a long way from where it used to stand on identity issues. However, that does not mean that we’re close to an equal society or that we’ve dismantled systemic and inherent bias.</p>
<p>Most probably, the solution to this series of issues isn’t to simply check boxes in our marketing, branding, or interface guidelines, but rather adopt an approach that features continuous inquiry and thorough analysis.</p>
<p>An essential part of the solution to systemic under- or misrepresentation is diversity in the workplace. It’s essential that organizations empower minorities and favor their participation in branding and marketing decision-making. As a result, this could lead to a more accurate and self-aware outlook on issues of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity.</p>
<p>No matter how much empathy he has or how much good intention behind his actions, a white male might still carry some bias.</p>
<p>Indeed, black lives matter.</p>
<p>But we must also remain mindful of the idea that this is but a point of departure towards a better society and better technology.</p></raw>  </div> <outline-share shortcode="hr4jj9" articletitle="On racism and sexism in branding, user interface, and tech"><div class="share-wrapper"> <div class="copy-link-field"> <span class="url" id="copy-target"> https://outline.com/hr4jj9 </span> <button class="copy-button" data-clipboard-target="#copy-target" alt="Copy to clipboard"> Copy </button> </div> <div class="share-links-wrapper noselect"> <outline-annotations><button class="annotations-btn" data-hypothesis-trigger=""> <span class="icon-wrapper"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 32 32" version="1.1" x="0px" y="0px"><g stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g fill="#000000"><path d="M2,8.99620271 C2,6.78916089 3.78429328,5 5.99005301,5 L22.009947,5 C24.2135924,5 26,6.78883037 26,8.99620271 L26,17.0037973 C26,19.2108391 26,22.7893827 26,24.9954491 L26,23.5515516 C26,25.2123152 25.0400467,25.6282404 23.8480841,24.4729866 L20.2647417,21 L6.00827507,21 C3.79456588,21 2,19.2111696 2,17.0037973 L2,8.99620271 Z"></path></g></g></svg> </span> <span class="label-wrapper"> Annotations </span> </button></outline-annotations> <span class="separator">·</span> <a class="report-link soft-link" target="_top" href="https://www.outline.com/report.html?url=http://outline.com/hr4jj9"> Report a problem </a> </div>  </div></outline-share>  </div> <outline-toolbar><div class="outline-toolbar outline-toolbar--fixed outline-toolbar--hidden"> <div class="outline-toolbar-wrapper"> <div class="desktop"> <div class="brand-mark"> <div class="brand"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="255px" height="57px" viewBox="0 0 255 57" version="1.1" class="outline-toolbar-wordmark" src="https://outline.com/images/wordmark.svg">
