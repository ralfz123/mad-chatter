      <td align="center">Git and npm are used; the project runs without errors; data is loaded; there is a view that represents the data</td>
      <td align="center"><strong>Views are rendered dynamically from data</strong>; interpreting the representation is easier that interpreting the raw data itself</td>
      <td align="center"><strong>Data can be read and changed; changes to data are reflected in the interface; changes persist across page reloads</strong></td>
      <td align="center">Views go beyond an example or tutorial: there are demonstrable additions <strong>like routing or creating data</strong></td>
      <td align="center">ðŸ˜±<br>The way the student applies subject matter is more advanced than what they were taught in class; letâ€™s switch places</td>

      <td align="center">There is substantial own code and the student can explain how the project was created</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain some parts of their code, how some parts works together, and some technical choices</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain every part of their code; the project is structured logically. The student can explain the merits of frameworks inr elation to their project</td>
      <td align="center">The project is complex but can easily be understood; student used or wrote code not covered in class that was carefully chosen while weighing alternatives</td>
      <td align="center">ðŸ¤“<br>The student deeply understands their code and a geeky / nerdy conversation can be held about this</td>

> **Note**: each of this rubricâ€™s rows is cumulative: for example, to get a 5-6
> on application, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4. In addition, each row has to be awarded with a >=5.5 in order to receive a passing grade for this course.
> Bonus points can be rewarded when you've helped fellow students progress. But only if you already have a passing grade.
