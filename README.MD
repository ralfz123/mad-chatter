#### Team exercise: build a chat app with socket.io
[Repo link (`team-page` branche)](https://github.com/ralfz123/real-time-web-2021/tree/team-page)

## :rocket: Purpose of Project
During this course you will learn how to build a real-time application. You will learn techniques to setup an open connection between the client and the server. This will enable you to send data in real-time both ways, at the same time.

The course Real-Time Web is about learning how to build a real-time application. Real-Time Web is part of the half year minor programme about Web Design and Development in Amsterdam. Bachelor Communication and Multimedia Design, Amsterdam University of Applied Science.

## :heart_eyes: Concept
<!-- First I rebuild the chat app, and now I got a better understanding how socket.io works.

Features:
- Send chat to every client
- Display name of other client
- Client name is equal to "Yourself"

Now, I have an good concept about cooking, because I like cooking a lot! Here's the concept: -->

>_This is the solution for cooking together in Corona-times :fork_and_knife:._

This application is an app where you can cook with each other on distance (each person from his/her own house). You start the application where you can both search on recipes by entering some food ingredients that you have in your house. When you both are agree with one recipe, you click on that recipe and you can start cooking. You both set a timer about how long you think it will take to cook the recipe. Also you follow the instructions of the recipe and you can check them by the checkboxes. The person who finishes the dish first is the winner :trophy: .


### Sketches

</figure>

### Spike
#### Timer and Instructions challenge 
- Is this a good challenge
- Have to pick the timer or the instructions or combine both?

### Improvements
Ik heb data gerenderd van de recepten clientside, zodat server niet wordt overloaded door de serverside rendering

#### Features
**Login**  
- Authenticated login with username and password
- Create rooms of 2 persons

**App**  
- You can search through recipes by entering a ingredient
- You can chat with each other to talk about which recipe you pick
- You can set a timer and follow the instructions of the recipe both on the same time (real-time :wink: )

## :nerd_face: Technical summary 
This app is built, using:
- [Socket.io](http://socket.io/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Node.js server](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express router](https://expressjs.com/)
- [EJS Templating engine](https://ejs.co/)
- [Heroku deployment](https://www.heroku.com/nodejs)

## :nerd_face: Code Conventions
I prefer to work with these dev-rules for myself:
- Use of semicolon at the end of the line
- Spaces: 2
- Code comments
    - param explanation of functions
    - inline code comments after variable declaration
- naming of variables and functions has to be descriptive
- ES6 modules

# :1234: Data
### APIs are:
1. (x) [spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Analyze-Recipe)
2. [mealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

The data variables I used, are:
#### 1. Lorem ispum
- `id`
- `lorem`  


### Dataset structure
#### 1. Lorem ispum

```js
{
    id: 123,
    lorem: "lorem"
}
```
